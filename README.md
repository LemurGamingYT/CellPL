 Custom programming language written in python.

to use, run the following command
```python3 cell.py [file]``` and if that works, you can just run `run.bat` or if that does not work then use the ```python cell.py [file]``` command

the default file that will be ran is the test.cell file (found in the examples/ directory)

you will need to pip install antlr4 by running ```pip3 install antlr-python3-runtime``` command or ```pip install antlr-python3-runtime``` command

to install pip you need to run ```python -m ensurepip --upgrade``` or ```python get-pip.py``` (get the file from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)
